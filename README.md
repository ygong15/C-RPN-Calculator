# C-RPN-Calculator

This is a fully functional RPN calculater. Please take a look!

You can enter complicated math expression such as 2^4*[(3+2)/5] and the program will use the 
shunting yard algorithm to convert the expression into Reverse Polish notation

The program uses a stack to perform the shunting yard algorithm and the actual calculation

The program can also detect errors in math expressions such as missing parentheses
However the error detection function may still have some bugs

P.S. Sorry for the lack of comments. The program was developed for a CS class test so I had no time to write thorough comments
